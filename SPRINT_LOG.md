# Sprint Log — Zartex SEI Project 1

---

## Day 1 — May 18, 2026

**Phase:** 1 — Foundation
**Goal:** Go fundamentals + HTTP /health server
**Schedule:** All 5 members, same tasks, no role split today

### Completed

- All 5 members completed tour.golang.org sections 1–13
  (variables, types, functions, structs, pointers, error handling, methods)
- All 5 members read Go by Example: error handling, closures, interfaces
- All 5 members built HTTP server: GET /health returns {"status": "ok"}
- All 5 members tested server with curl — all returning correct JSON
- EOD confidence ratings posted in group chat

### What Was Harder Than Expected

- Pointers — the difference between value and address took time to click
- Understanding why pointer receivers are needed on struct methods
- Interfaces — the concept of implicit implementation (no 'implements' keyword)

### What Was Easier Than Expected

- Setting up the HTTP server — Go's net/http package is straightforward
- JSON encoding — json.NewEncoder(w).Encode() just works

### Phase 1 Gate Status

- [ ] All 5 members: HTTP server returns {"status":"ok"} on GET /health
- [ ] All 5 members: Go fundamentals tour complete
